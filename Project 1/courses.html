                    <h3>Freshman Year: Fall</h3>
                    <p>Good times during my freshman year. The courses I took were easy peasy. Except for Calculus I. You know that this semester I had all 8 am's? The only bright side to this was that at least I had one more hour of sleep than I did when I was in high school. I woke up at 6 am during high school, so freshman year I woke up at 7 am.</p>

                    <p>Back again to college. Not much to say about that. I think my favorite class this semester was Drawing I because I really enjoy drawing. Psychology was interesting, the best part about that class watching the movie Parenthood starring Steve Martin. Worst part of that class was writing about Parenthood starring Steve Martin.</p>
